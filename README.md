# Simple Calculator
This was made as part of The Odin Project.

## Math Functions
This calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
It can clear memory, delete characters, input only 1 decimal, detect divide by zero, and function in a chain doing continuous calculations on a pair of numbers without pressing the equals button.

## Style Notes
This was an opportunity to implement many CSS features I had been interested in trying.

## Dark Mode switch

## Neon sign with effect on hover
In dark mode, hovering brightens the sign.

## Pulse on hover for the switch
In darkmode, 2 second pulsing animation.

## Bottom signature hover effect, mode dependant
Transform background of signature with different colors.
