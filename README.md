# Simple Calculator
This was made as part of The Odin Project.

## Math Functions
This calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Can clear memory, delete characters, input only 1 decimal, detect divide by zero, and function in a chain doing continuous calculations on a pair of numbers without pressing equals.

## Style Notes
This was an opportunity to implement many CSS features I had been interested in.

### Dark Mode switch

#### Neon sign effect with hover
In dark mode, hovering brightens the sign.

#### Pulse on hover for the switch
In darkmode, 2 second growing pulse animation.

### Bottom signature hover effect, mode dependant
Transform background with different colors.
